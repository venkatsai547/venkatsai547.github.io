Hi friends, hope you are doing good. This is maiden post. Here I'll talk about inserting math symbols or equations
in our well known tool, Microsoft Powerpoint. Though this approach is not very famous among the users, some of them
might have used Latex beamer class for creating slides with lots of math equations, this is really helpful if someone
needs a quick solution. This approach combines the the power of $\LaTeX$ with the nicety of Powerpoint.
