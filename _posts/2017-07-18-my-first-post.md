Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. It can hadle math as well with the help of mathjax. See below:

The p.d.f of a Gaussian distribution is given by,

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^2}
$$
